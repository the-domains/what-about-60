What about 60? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c9422ee4-c213-44c6-8dfa-2edd8f357bbc.png)

Not too long ago, I turned 60\. At the time, I really didn't think about the number as anything too different than 50, or 40, or 30 even. Probably because I was so busy at the time, I didn't really stop long enough to consider if it might be different than any other decade.

What about life? What about all those times I have forgotten about? What about the memories? That were made in the 30's, the 40's, how the 50's were the transition from what we knew of the old and familiar to what has grown from the old and familiar... moving on at a pace far more rapid than it should. 

Some things never change, and you wish they would. Some things have changed and you wished they would't have. The things you have no control over, the things where you sometimes feel like you are a spectator, watching from a distance and even though you are in the midst of the situation, somehow you aren't invited to make a difference. It's a shame that no one took you seriously enough to ask your opinion, and when on a rare occasion they did, you doubt you really made a difference. Yes, it is a shame. 

Oh, the things I know now, that I wish I had known then. Those words are beginning to pop up in my mind more frequently than in the past. Words I never thought would have such an impact on our future. For it is in the present I am thinking these thoughts. And I do not know where they will lead me. That is surprising to me. I always knew where I was going, or at least I thought I did.

What about tomorrow? What have I learned from the past that I will take with me tomorrow, and beyond? What will I let go of that weighs me down? What will I embrace that lifts me up? What will I cling to that pulls me toward the best that is yet to come? Who will come with me? And where will we go? To what heights will we soar?

> I used to think there was a connection. A connection between here and there, that aligns the souls along the path to common goals, and bonds them in a way that can't be described other than a feeling of focused certainty that this is so. Somedays, I still do. This feeling of certainty is as focused as it once was. 

Life has stepped in and shifted the focus a bit. In all, that were on that path, a change occurred with them as well. We all grew in directions of personal evolvement and some out paced others, leading to an unaligned presence. We cannot stop! We must move forward! For LIFE will move forward without us if we stop.
