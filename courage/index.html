Some things have changed and you wished they would't have. The things you have no control over, the things where you sometimes feel like you are a spectator, watching from a distance and even though you are in the midst of the situation, somehow you aren't invited to make a difference. It's a shame that no one took you seriously enough to ask your opinion, and when on a rare occasion they did, you doubt you really made a difference. Yes, it is a shame. </p><p>Oh, the things I know now, that I wish I had known then. Those words are beginning to pop up in my mind more frequently than in the past. Words I never thought would have such an impact on our future. For it is in the present I am thinking these thoughts. And I do not know where they will lead me. That is surprising to me.

To what heights will we soar? </p><blockquote><p data-grid-id="2a270ad6-a8cb-40d7-9f57-c16d0bd98c89">I used to think there was a connection. A connection between here and there, that aligns the souls along the path to common goals, and bonds them in a way that can't be described other than a feeling of focused certainty that this is so. Somedays, I still do. This feeling of certainty is as focused as it once was. </p></blockquote><p>Life has stepped in and shifted the focus a bit. In all, that were on that path, a change occurred with them as well. We all grew in directions of personal evolvement and some out paced others, leading to an unaligned presence. We cannot stop! We must move forward! For LIFE will move forward without us if we stop.
